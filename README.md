This is our course project for IS477. Our project aims to analyze NFL team salaries and how much each team allocates to each position group (quarterback, wide receivers, offensive line, defensive line, etc.) in relation to team performance in the regular season and playoffs.  Our core objective is to see how efficiently teams are allocating their financial investments so that it best translates to on field success. Our ultimate goal is to create an ideal allocation model that will demonstrate what percentage of the salary cap each position should take up in order to maximize performance and wins.
